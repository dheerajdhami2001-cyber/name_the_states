# üáÆüá≥ Indian States Guesser

This project is an interactive, educational desktop game built entirely with Python and its native Turtle graphics library. The objective is to name all 28 states of India on a map. Correct guesses are placed on the map using coordinate data managed by the `pandas` library, allowing the user to track progress toward a perfect score.

## üñºÔ∏è Gameplay Demo


## Features

*   **Interactive Map GUI:** Uses the native Python `turtle` module for the graphical interface and input.
*   **Coordinate-Based Labeling:** Correct state names are dynamically written onto the map at their precise coordinates.
*   **Data Integration:** Utilizes the `pandas` library to efficiently look up state names and their map coordinates from a CSV file.
*   **Live Score Tracking:** A progress tracker displays the number of states correctly identified (e.g., `X/28 States Correct`).
*   **Robust Input:** Input is automatically handled to be case-insensitive for easier use.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x installed on your system.
*   The `pandas` library is required. This project uses the built-in `turtle` module.
